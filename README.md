# Readme

This is a clone of the classic arcade game, space invaders, in C++ using only a few dependencies. It is meant as a companion to [this series of tutorial posts](http://nicktasios.nl/posts/space-invaders-from-scratch-part-1.html).

## My Future work will be at https://github.com/Dreded/SpaceInvaders as it is straying from this source
